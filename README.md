# Summary
This is a basic asteroids game written entirely in C++ using GLUT and Open GL for graphics. 
I made this game with Matt Rieger. We used starter code provided by Lisa Dion.

Note:
I am a Mac user running Catalina, so the dimensions of multiplied by 2, but it may appear too big on your machine. 
To fix this, delete the *2 from width and height on each glViewport line in graphics.cpp display function.

# How to Play 
The goal is to avoid hitting the asteroids with your spaceship for as long as possible.

## One player mode

Move the spaceship using the arrow keys. You can also press period to rotate.

## Two player mode

Move the second spaceship using the w,s,a, and d keys. To rotate, press 'q'.
